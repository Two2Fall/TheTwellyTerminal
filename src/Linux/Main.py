TheTwellyUtil.py       — A util for terminals created by Twell Evans

The Twelly Util is a util created by me that helps Two2Fall (Also known as Twell Evans)
to be able to program better with an stylized terminal written in python. This does not
need commands and dependencies so I hope you like this!

Used modules:
    - rich
    - time
    - subprocess
    - os
    - random
    - sys
    - signal
